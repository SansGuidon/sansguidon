# About me :alien:
- Who am I ? I’m Morgan and I’m Belgian :belgium:, from Brussels 🍻 🍫. I’m a programming geek and proud dad 👨‍🍼, with a lot of imagination, an appetite for knowledge 📚 🕸️ , information sharing and I enjoy too many passions to keep up with everything.
- What do I do ? I'm a software engineer by education and practice but I work as DevOps/Cloud Infrastructure Engineer ☁️, and I miss the fun of working with modern programming languages, so that's something I want to fix at work or via hobby projects, anything involving AI, video games  🎮, productivity, positively impacting people.
